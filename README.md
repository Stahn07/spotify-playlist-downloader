####So if you wanted to download "Top 100 Hip-Hop Tracks on Spotify". You would use the following command:

	spd -u yourusername -p yourpassword -l spotify:user:spotify:playlist:06KmJWiQhL0XiV6QQAHsmw

`spd` is the shorthand for `spotify-playlist-downloader`. You can use either one.

####The output should look something like:
